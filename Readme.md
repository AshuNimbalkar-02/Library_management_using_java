A Library Management System in Java typically performs basic CRUD operations to manage books and members. It allows you to Create new records (like adding books or users), Read existing data (searching or listing books), Update details (editing book information or user data), and Delete records (removing books or members). These operations are usually implemented using Java classes, collections, or databases to maintain and manipulate library data efficiently.
